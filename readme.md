## Architecture

    Main objective of the Architecture is separation concerns and DRY (Don't repeat yourself).
    I developed complete application with the help of following Technologies.

    Frontend - Angular with ng Zorro framework
    Backend - Node (Express js) with Mongodb


    The Node is a javascript runtime, with the help of express js we can easily developed the API's.

    i follows the api name convensions recommend by  microsoft (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design)

    I use mongoose package. this package help us to get interface between the mongodb and node/express js

    The MongoDB database is an Nosql Database. fast-growing database no releations projects.in that i use mongodb atlas - cloud solution for accessing manipulate the DB.
